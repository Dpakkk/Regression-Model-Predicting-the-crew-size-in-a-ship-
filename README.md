# Regression-Model-Predicting-the-crew-size-in-a-ship-


OBJECTIVE:

This is a challenge Project in a Data Science

Objective: Build a regressor that recommends the “crew” size for potential ship buyers from the given data set. Please do the following steps (hint: use numpy, scipy, pandas, sklearn and matplotlib)

The question of this analysis is described below:

    Read the file and display columns.

    Calculate basic statistics of the data (count, mean, std, etc) and examine data and state your observations.

    Select columns that will be probably important to predict “crew” size.

    If you removed columns explain why you removed those.

    Use one-hot encoding for categorical features.

    Create training and testing sets (use 60% of the data for the training and reminder for testing).

    Build a machine learning model to predict the ‘crew’ size.

    Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient for the training set and testing data sets.

    Describe hyper-parameters in your model and how you would change them to improve the performance of the model.

    What is regularization? What is the regularization parameter in your model?
    


Plot regularization parameter value vs Pearson correlation for the test and training sets, and see whether your model has a bias problem or variance problem.

Remarks: This is an example of a very straightforward problem. The dataset is clean and small (160 rows and 9 columns), and the instructions are very clear. So all what is needed is to follow the instructions and generate the code.
